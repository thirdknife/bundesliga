# Thinking
- I have used JavaScript to solve the problem. JavaScript tooling to write client side and server is great.
- Selected React for writing the front end application.
- Using Redux for state management.
- Using fetch isomorphic to consume the Match API.
- Code is modular and is divided per page.
